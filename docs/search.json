Currently, the cost to join is only $5 for both non-students and students.\r\nThe SRMA SIG has a total of 119 members.\r\nHistory\r\nThe SRMA SIG was conceptualized after the 2011 AERA in New Orleans by Terri Pigott and Josh Polanin. The first annual business meeting was held at the 2014 AERA in Philadelphia. The first substantive program was held at the 2015 AERA in Chicago. The SRMA SIG received official SIG Status in Fall 2018. The first elections were held at the end of 2020.\r\nBylaws\r\nThe bylaws that govern the SRMA SIG can be found here.\r\nDisclaimer\r\nThis website represents the news, updates, and general purposes of the SRMA SIG of the American Educational Research Association (AERA).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Polanin\r\nPronouns: he/him/his\r\nI am a principal researcher in the Human Services division at American Institutes for Research (AIR). I am a quantitative methodologist working across education, criminology, public health, and methodology. I have several projects ongoing, including, as Principal Investigator, a National Science Foundation project Effects of the Engagement, Exploration, Explanation, Elaboration, and Evaluation Instructional Model: Systematic Review and Innovation Through New Meta-Analysis Methodology, which is conducting a comprehensive review of the 5E instructional model as well as creating the first open-source, collaborative relational database specifically for conducting systematic reviews. In 2020, I won the Early Career Award from the Society for Research on Educational Evaluation.\r\nProgram Chair\r\n\r\nQi Zhang\r\nPronouns: he/him/his\r\nI’m a researcher in the Research and Evaluation Division at American Institutes for Research (AIR). I provide quantitative methodological support for program and policy evaluation in education. My research interests include the evidence synthesis, design and analysis of experiments and quasi-experiments, multi-level statistical modeling, and power analysis for multi-level moderation and mediation. My research has been published in journals including AERAOpen, Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, and Journal of Research on Educational Effectiveness. I hold a Ph.D. in Evaluation, Measurement, and Research in Education from Western Michigan University.\r\nTreasurer\r\n\r\nSunyoung Park\r\nPronouns: she/her/hers\r\nI am an Assistant Professor in Graduate Psychology and the Master of Science Program in Clinical Psychology at California Lutheran University. I joined CLU’s faculty in 2018 as assistant professor. I have served as a committee member of Graduate Academic Standards at CLU. I received my bachelor’s degree in Korean literature and psychology from Sogang University. And, I received master’s degree in measurement and statistics from Korea University and master’s degree in program evaluation from University of Texas at Austin. Then, I worked at Institute of Education Sciences grant, Meadows Center for Preventing Educational Risk, and Department of Educational Psychology as graduate research assistantship where I earned a doctoral degree in 2018 from the Educational Psychology department specializing in quantitative methods. I have expertise in quantitative methods as applied to the social behavioral sciences including meta-analysis and multilevel models. \r\nSecretary\r\n\r\nLaura Michaelson\r\nPronouns: she/her/hers\r\nI’m a senior researcher in the Human Services division at the American Institutes for Research (AIR). I use quantitative modeling and evidence synthesis to improve the use and translation of evidence in youth development. I also develop interactive data visualizations and open-source software tools to support systematic review and meta-analysis methods. My research has been published in academic journals including Psychological Science, Developmental Science, and Behavioral and Brain Sciences, and has also been featured in the popular press, such as Medium. I have worked on multiple evidence clearinghouse entities including the What Works Clearinghouse and Blueprints for Healthy Youth Development and am a co-founder of the Methods of Synthesis and Integration Center (MOSAIC) at AIR.\r\nGraduate Student Member-at-Large\r\n\r\nMegha Joshi\r\nPronouns: she/her/hers\r\nI am a quantitative methodologist and a data scientist. I recently graduated from The University of Texas at Austin Quantitative Methods program. For my dissertation, I examined methods to handle dependent effects sizes in meta-analysis with a small number of studies. I have also consulted on applied meta-analyses in education and political science providing methodological and programming support to analyze data with complex structures. Moreover, I have experience organizing for graduate student rights at UT Austin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
